# Predicting Survivals

The project main objective is to predict the survivals using many supervised learning techniques they are the following:
     Logistic Regression
     Decision Trees 
     Random Forest
     Support Vector Machine
     Support Vector Machine With Grid Search

All using Titanic dataset and this project is only one trial to compare between the different technique in Python and each file contains for example but not limited to the following 
  
### Decision Trees and Random Forest Trail
      #### Exploratory Data Analysis
            1. Plotting the data
      #### Cleansing data
            1. Dealing with a missing data by the following
                Filled in some missing values 
                Dropped some few missing values
           2. Dealing with categorical features by the following
                Creating a dummy variables
      #### Modeling
          1. Splitting the data into training and testing  
          2. Training the classification model 
          3. Building the Confusion Matrix
